# Messages for Task: rotate100

## System Message

```
You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of Verilog and hardware designing. Generate Verilog code for the given task. I will tip you $200 if you can fulfill the tasks I give you.Build a 100-bit left/right rotator, with synchronous load and left/right enable. A rotator shifts-in the shifted-out bit from the other end of the register, unlike a shifter that discards the shifted-out bit and shifts in a zero. If enabled, a rotator rotates the bits around and does not modify/discard them. 
// (1) load: Loads shift register with data[99:0] instead of rotating. Synchronous active high.
// (2) ena[1:0]: Synchronous. Chooses whether and which direction to rotate: 
//     (a) 2'b01 rotates right by one bit, 
//     (b) 2'b10 rotates left by one bit, 
//     (c) 2'b00 and 2'b11 do not rotate. 
// (3) q: The contents of the rotator.

The header you have already known is:module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [1:0] ena,
	input [99:0] data,
	output reg [99:0] q);


Please only reply with the Verilog code after syntax check, no other words.
Please always begin with `module top_module()`.
