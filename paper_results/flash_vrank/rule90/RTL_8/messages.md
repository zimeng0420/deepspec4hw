You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of Verilog and hardware designing. Generate Verilog code for the given task. I will tip you $200 if you can fulfill the tasks I give you.

Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:
// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state
// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0
// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1
// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 
// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

The header you have already known is:module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [511:0] data,
	output reg [511:0] q);


Please only reply with the Verilog code after syntax check, no other words.
Please always begin with `module top_module()`.
