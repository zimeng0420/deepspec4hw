# Task: gshare

## Prompt to Generate Queries

Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Instructions:
- Single Query First: By default, generate only one search query. Add additional queries only if the original question covers multiple distinct aspects that cannot be addressed by a single query.
- One Focus per Query: Each query must concentrate on one specific aspect of the original question, avoiding mixed or overlapping topics in a single query.
- Sufficiently Detailed: Queries should include enough technical detail to enable a deep understanding of the research topic and to support solving the task.
- Relevant to Task and I/O: Each query must stay closely tied to the key technical terms in the task description and the input/output (I/O) port definitions in the context of the research topic.
- Diversity: If the research topic is broad, generate multiple diverse queries, with each query addressing a different perspective or subtopic.
- No Redundancy: Do not generate multiple queries that are semantically similar. One well-phrased query is sufficient for each topic.


Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL three of these exact keys:
   - "query": A list of search queries
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   

Example:

Topic: Determine the next-state logic expressions for outputs Y2 and Y4 in a one-hot encoded FSM. 

module top_module (
  input [6:1] y,
  input w,
  output Y2,
  output Y4,
    

```json
{
    "query": ["What is one-hot encoding in finite state machines?", "How are next-state signals derived in a one-hot encoded FSM?", "What do the inputs y[6:1] and w represent in the FSM?"],

    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, Understanding how one-hot encoding represents states and how inputs like y[6:1] and w influence transitions is essential for correctly deriving next-state logic in a finite state machine. These concepts form the foundation for interpreting and implementing FSM behavior in Verilog.",
}    
```

Context: 
- User: SEQ
Build a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. 
// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. 
// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.
// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4. Reset is asynchronous active-high.
