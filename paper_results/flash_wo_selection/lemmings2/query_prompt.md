# Task: lemmings2

## Prompt to Generate Queries

Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Instructions:
- Single Query First: By default, generate only one search query. Add additional queries only if the original question covers multiple distinct aspects that cannot be addressed by a single query.
- One Focus per Query: Each query must concentrate on one specific aspect of the original question, avoiding mixed or overlapping topics in a single query.
- Sufficiently Detailed: Queries should include enough technical detail to enable a deep understanding of the research topic and to support solving the task.
- Relevant to Task and I/O: Each query must stay closely tied to the key technical terms in the task description and the input/output (I/O) port definitions in the context of the research topic.
- Diversity: If the research topic is broad, generate multiple diverse queries, with each query addressing a different perspective or subtopic.
- No Redundancy: Do not generate multiple queries that are semantically similar. One well-phrased query is sufficient for each topic.


Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL three of these exact keys:
   - "query": A list of search queries
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   

Example:

Topic: Determine the next-state logic expressions for outputs Y2 and Y4 in a one-hot encoded FSM. 

module top_module (
  input [6:1] y,
  input w,
  output Y2,
  output Y4,
    

```json
{
    "query": ["What is one-hot encoding in finite state machines?", "How are next-state signals derived in a one-hot encoded FSM?", "What do the inputs y[6:1] and w represent in the FSM?"],

    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, Understanding how one-hot encoding represents states and how inputs like y[6:1] and w influence transitions is essential for correctly deriving next-state logic in a finite state machine. These concepts form the foundation for interpreting and implementing FSM behavior in Verilog.",
}    
```

The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. 
// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.
// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input areset,
	input bump_left,
	input bump_right,
	input ground,
	output walk_left,
	output walk_right,
	output aaah
);
