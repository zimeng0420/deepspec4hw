You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of Verilog and hardware designing. Generate only a technical specification for the given task. I will tip you $200 if you can fulfill the tasks I give you.A priority encoder is a combinational circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first 1 bit in the vector. For example, a 8-bit priority encoder given the input 8'b10010000 would output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high. Build a 4-bit priority encoder. For this problem, if none of the input bits are high (i.e., input is zero), output zero. Note that a 4-bit number has 16 possible combinations.

The header you have already known is:module top_module (
	input [3:0] in,
	output reg [1:0] pos
);
