# Messages for Task: lfsr5

## System Message

```
You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of Verilog and hardware designing. Generate Verilog code for the given task. I will tip you $200 if you can fulfill the tasks I give you.A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset the LFSR output to 1.

```
The header you have already known is:module top_module(
	input clk,
	input reset,
	output reg [4:0] q);




Please only reply with the Verilog code, no other words.

Please always begin with `module top_module()`.
