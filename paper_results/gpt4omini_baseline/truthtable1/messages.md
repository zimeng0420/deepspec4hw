Create a combinational circuit that implements the truth table.

// x3 | x2 | x1 | f
// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
// 0 | 0 | 1 | 0
// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1
// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1
// 1 | 1 | 0 | 0
// 1 | 1 | 1 | 1

The header you have already known is:module top_module (
	input x3,
	input x2,
	input x1,
	output f
);


Please only reply with the Verilog code after syntax check, no other words.
Please always begin with `module top_module()`.
