You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of Verilog and hardware designing. Generate only a technical specification for the given task. I will tip you $200 if you can fulfill the tasks I give you.The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following one-hot state encoding: A=4'b0001, B=4'b0010, C=4'b0100, D=4'b1000. Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. 
// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
// A | A, B | 0
// B | C, B | 0
// C | A, D | 0
// D | C, B | 1

The header you have already known is:module top_module (
	input in,
	input [3:0] state,
	output reg [3:0] next_state,
	output out
);
