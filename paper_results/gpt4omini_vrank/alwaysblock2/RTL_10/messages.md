```
You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of Verilog, Python and hardware designing. Generate Verilog code for the given task. I will tip you $200 if you can reply with the Verilog code after syntax check.
Build an XOR gate three ways, using an assign statement (output out_assign), a combinational always block (output out_always_comb), and a clocked always block (output out_always_ff). Note that the clocked always block produces a different circuit from the other two: There is a flip-flop so the output is delayed.

Please only reply with the Verilog code, no other words.

Please always begin with `module top_module()`. Build an XOR gate three ways, using an assign statement (output out_assign), a combinational always block (output out_always_comb), and a clocked always block (output out_always_ff). Note that the clocked always block produces a different circuit from the other two: There is a flip-flop so the output is delayed.module top_module(
	input clk,
	input a, 
	input b,
	output out_assign,
	output reg out_always_comb,
	output reg out_always_ff
);
